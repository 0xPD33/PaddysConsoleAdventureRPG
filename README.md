Text Adventure-RPG in C#

This is a text-based Adventure-RPG that I'm currently developing to learn C# syntax. It's a console application, because working with forms is still a bit too much for me.

I tried making a Tower-Defense game in Unity, but I noticed it was too hard, so I'll try to improve this game first to learn.

I'm still very much at the beginning and it would make me happy, if someone could help.
